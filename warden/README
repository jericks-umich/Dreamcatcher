Inserting this package into the OpenWRT build system is a little 
hard to parse.

The Makefile in this directory is run by OpenWRT's build system,
described here: https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages

We choose to include the source in the package directory itself
(most packages are downloaded from remote servers at build-time),
which usually means we would include a Makefile inside the src/
directory as well.

However, to compile on the OpenWRT-specific hardware, we want to
use the OpenWRT buildroot system, one component of which is a
mips-openwrt-linux-musl-gcc compiler that is *also* made during
the build process... so rather than try to monkeypatch that 
together, we're just using the Build/Compile target in OpenWRT's
outer Makefile.
